def viterbi(A, P, Pi=None):
    """
    Return the MAP estimate of state trajectory of Hidden Markov Model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : array (K, K)
        State transition matrix. See HiddenMarkovModel.state_transition  for
        details. Example: [[1->1, 1->2],[2->1, 2->2]]
    P: array(T, K)
        Probability of being of state k given observation in time t - calculated via DNN.
        Example: [[Prob. of 0.3 to be in state 1 at time 0 given the data, Prob of 0.7 to be in state 2 at t = 0], [prob of 0.4 for state 1 at time 1, prob of 0.6 for state 2 at time 2]]
    Pi: optional, (K,)
        Initial state probabilities: Pi[i] is the probability x[0] == i. If
        None, uniform initial distribution is assumed (Pi[:] == 1/K).



    Returns
    -------
    x : array (T,)
        Maximum a posteriori probability estimate of hidden state trajectory,
        conditioned on observation sequence y under the model parameters A, B,
        Pi.
        Example: [0 0 1] means that the most likely a posteriori path is state 0, state 0, state 1
    T1: array (K, T)
        the probability of the most likely path so far
        Example:
        [[0.3     0.084   0.00588]
       [0.04    0.027   0.01512]]
       means prob. of 0.3 to be in State 0 at time 0 and  prob. of 0.04 to be in Staate 1 at t=0;  prob. of 0.084 to be in State 0 at t=1, (c.f. T2 to find the most likely path to get there);
       prob of 0.027 to be in State 1 at time t=1 (c.f. T2 to find the most likely path to get there)
        the x_j-1 of the most likely path so far
